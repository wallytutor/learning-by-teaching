# Theoretical and Numerical Combustion

Study notes from the book by [@Poinsot2022TNC] and complementary information from their [web page](https://elearning.cerfacs.fr/combustion/index.php). The main motivations for studying combustion is that it is and will still be the main source of energy for humankind. Given its complexity, we cannot tackle all of its intricacies without recurring to simulation. Nevertheless, simulation alone without the minimal theory background is dangerous. With the current available computing power, a transition towards more compute-intensive _LES_ approaches is replacing classical _RANS_, even in situations where steady treatment has been long the standard. It is thus necessary to understand the numerical aspects of the more powerful and detailed transient models, a matter that will progressively be treated here. A foreword and motivation for delving into the subject is provided [in this video](https://elearning.cerfacs.fr/combustion/n7masterCourses/introduction/index.php).
