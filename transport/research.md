## Calcite particles decomposition

- According to [@Scaltsoyiannes2020], calcium-looping (CaL) can also be used for energy storage in concentrated solar power plants.

- Types of models listed by [@Scaltsoyiannes2020]:

    - Shrinking core model (SCM), only external surface participates at mass exchange.
    - Random pore model (RPM), randomly distributed cylindrical pores for exchange.
    - Grain model (GM), pores are voids in between solid grains.
    - Uniform conversion model (UCM).

- [Tammann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammann_and_H%C3%BCttig_temperatures) temperature of $CaCO_3$ is low, so sintering phenomena cannot be neglected.

- Flow rate and $CO_2$ partial pressure do not affect the $CaCO_3$ decomposition kinetics in the range of conditions studied by [@Scaltsoyiannes2020]; on the other hand, decreasing particle size from 500 to 100 $\mu{}m$ increases reaction rate, while below this value the internal resistance of mass transfer is negligible and rates no longer increase.
