Collective departure on Saturday 26 July 2025 at 7:00 am from Courmayeur, in via delle Forges 3 (4810 Courmayeur).

The competitor must arrive at least 15 minutes before the start to be registered. Once the competitor is confirmed at the start, he/she must remain within the "starting area" space specifically delimited by the organization and will not be able to leave it until the start (except in cases of overt necessity).

The athlete who is not validated will be "not started" and will not be included among the finishers.

**MAXIMUM TIME**

The maximum time of the race, to be included in the ranking, is set at 4 hours and 30 minutes with arrival at Punta Helbronner by 11:30 am.

- the possession of a sports medical certificate for competitive activity (D.M. 18.02.1982 tab. B) valid on the date of the race. Self-certification is not allowed (art.5 of the C.C. "Acts of disposition of one's own body") nor declaration of healthy and robust physical constitution issued by one's doctor.
    
- Be fully aware of the length and specificity of the race and be perfectly prepared.
    
- have acquired, before the race, a real capacity for personal autonomy in the mountains (NB: participation in other races is useful to acquire this experience, but it is not necessarily sufficient) to be able to better manage the problems related to this type of test
    
- be able to cope alone, without help, with climatic conditions that could become difficult due to the altitude (night, wind, cold, fog, rain or snow)
    
- be able to manage, even if you are isolated, physical or psychological problems due to great fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, muscle or joint pain, small wounds
    
- be aware that the role of the Organization is not to help a competitor to manage these problems and, for mountain running, safety depends on the ability of the individual to adapt to the problems encountered or foreseeable.
    
- Pets are not allowed.

### Semi autonomy

The principle of individual running in semi-autonomy is the rule.

Semi-autonomy is defined as the ability to be autonomous between two refreshment points, in terms of safety, power and equipment. This principle includes the following rules:

- Each athlete must carry all the mandatory equipment with him for the duration of the race (see paragraph EQUIPMENT). This must be carried in a backpack/bag and will be checked when the bibs are delivered (it is hoped that this material will be used during the race in an ethically correct way). At any time, the race marshals will be able to check the contents of the backpacks. The competitor is obliged to accept these checks, under penalty of disqualification.
    
- The refreshment points are stocked with drinks and food to be consumed on the spot. The organization only provides plain water to fill water bottles or camel bags. At the start of each refreshment point, competitors must have the necessary amount of water and food to get to the next refreshment point.
    
- It is forbidden to be accompanied on the course by a person who is not duly registered as a competitor.
### Water points and  refreshments

– hand in the helmet together with the athlete bag, and pick it up at the Pavillon in the area of the pole deposit to be worn

or

– hand over the helmet to a contact person, retrieve it once you arrive at the pavillon, by the volunteers. Each helmet will have the number corresponding to its bib.

Helmets are mandatory from fixed ropes onwards. No one will be able to proceed without a helmet. Anyone who arrives at the HIGH PYLON/MULE HUT fixed ropes area without a helmet will be disqualified and will not be able to proceed further.

Athletes who arrive at the finish line in Punta HELBRONNER wearing non-approved helmets (e.g. bike helmets) will be disqualified from the race.

**STICKS**

They can be used up to PAVILLON. Athletes who arrive at this point will abandon their poles to the volunteers. It will be the responsibility of the organization to recover them and return them to the athlete once the race is over. To collect your poles, it is MANDATORY to apply the sticker/tag of the bib number corresponding to the race number.
