## Creating a portable launcher

A simple way to create a portable launcher requiring to source extra variables is by writing a simple batch script exporting or calling another script with the definitions:

```batch
@echo off

@REM Add variables to be sourced here such as
@REM set PATH="/path/to/some/dir";%PATH%
@REM ... or call another shared script doing so.
@REM call %~dp0\env

MyCode.exe
```

Because a batch script will keep a console window open, create a VB file with the following

```vb
Set oShell = CreateObject ("Wscript.Shell") 
Dim strArgs
strArgs = "cmd /c MyCode.bat"
oShell.Run strArgs, 0, false
```

In the example we assume the program is called `MyCode.exe` and the batch script has been named in an analogous way `MyCode.bat`.

## Mount a network drive in WSL

Here we assume we will mount drive `Z:` at `/mnt/z`:

```bash
# Create the mount point (if required):
sudo mkdir /mnt/z

# Mount the network drive in WSL:
sudo mount -t drvfs Z: /mnt/z
```

## Following the writing to a file

This is equivalent to Linux `tail -f <file-path>`:

```bash
Get-Content -Path "<file-path>" -Wait
```
