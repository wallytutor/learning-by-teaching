# Heat conduction in Elmer

The goals of this set of cases is to:

- illustrate how to setup heat conduction in Elmer;
- compare solutions of the same problem in 2D and 3D;
- help on how to interpret symmetries and fluxes in Elmer;
- provide uses of data extraction during calculation.

Before following the discussion below, the reader is invited to check the guided setup of a reference case under [concept](concept/README.md). This is provided to facilitate the structuring of SIF files. Once the initial SIF file is generated, you can copy it to the `2d` directory, where is continue the discussion.

## Conduction in 2D

The case you find here is essentially the same as the one under [concept](concept/README.md). A few editions to the SIF file were performed so that we get ready to reuse it in 3D and run reproducibly with script automation.

As the script is expected to be manually edited from now on, we added comments (in SIF a comment line starts with a `!` as in Fortran - the main language of Elmer) splitting the case in logical blocks with *general* content, *material and its domain*, the *solvers*, and finally the *conditions*.

The location of the mesh was changed from default (the only supported location when using the GUI) to a directory called `domain` (same name of the `gmsh` file) by adding the following line to the `Header` section:

```c
Mesh DB "domain" "."
```

If you followed the [concept](concept/README.md) setup you should already have a mesh there, otherwise run:

```shell
gmsh - domain.geo
```

This can be converted to Elmer format with `ElmerGrid` by running:

```shell
ElmerGrid 14 2 domain.msh -autoclean -merge 1.0e-05
```

In this command `14` represents the `gmsh` input format and `2` the `ElmerSolver` file format. For the other options, please check the [documentation](https://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/physics/elmer/doc/ElmerGridManual.pdf).

For a standard sequential run simple enter:

```shell
ElmerSolver
```

It was not illustrated above, but it is important to redirect the output of these commands to log files so that they can be inspected for any errors or warnings. Results are dumped to `results/` directory as defined in the concept phase and can be inspected with [ParaView](../../../paraview/basics.md).

## Improved 2D case

After the initial run, a few manual additions were performed. Since they are always present and for better clarity, the following keywords are placed on top of each solver:

```c
Procedure = "HeatSolve" "HeatSolver"
Equation = Heat Equation
Exec Solver = Always
...
```

Finer control of outputs can be achieved with `ResultOutputSolver`; it was intentionally left outside of the concept for practicing the addition of solvers relying only on the documentation. Once this solver is added, option `Post File` from `Simulation` section needs to be removed. Output is configured to use binary VTU format since it has a lower disk footprint and is the default format for ParaView. The most important option here is `Save Geometry Ids`, allowing  for access to regions in the mesh. You can further configure this as in the docs. The collections of parts or time are left commented out for now.

```c
Solver 4
  Procedure = "ResultOutputSolve" "ResultOutputSolver"
  Equation = ResultOutput
  Exec Solver = After Saving

  Output File Name = case
  Output Format = vtu
  Binary Output = True
  Single Precision = False
  Save Geometry Ids = True
  ! Vtu Part Collection = True
  ! Vtu Time Collection = True
End
```

One **very important** thing to keep in mind when performing any FEA is that many desired post-processing quantities need to be evaluated at runtime. While in finite volumes one can easily integrated fluxes *by definition* and retrieve their integrals by accessing mesh surface areas, such concept is not available in finite elements and we need to integrate some computations while the simulation is running. Many aggregation methods are provided by `SaveData` solver. Below we request time and boundary integral of temperature flux (which by its turn is computed by `FluxSolver` that we added before) through the use of an operator.

```c
Solver 5
  Procedure = "SaveData" "SaveScalars"
  Equation = SaveScalars
  Exec Solver = After Timestep

  Filename = "scalars.dat"

  Variable 1 = Time

  Variable 2 = temperature Flux
  Operator 2 = boundary int
  Operator 3 = diffusive flux

  Variable 3 = temperature
  Operator 4 = nonlin converged
  Operator 5 = nonlin change
  Operator 6 = norm
End
```

Notice that in `SaveData` the operators have a sequential numbering and apply to the last variable preceding them. **Note:** the is an error in the official documentation and the keyword to store nonlinear change of a variable is actually `nonlin change`. Since the goal here is to compute only heat losses to the environment, we modified the corresponding boundary condition by adding `Save Scalars = True`:

```c
Boundary Condition 1
  Target Boundaries(1) = 2
  Name = "Environment"
  External Temperature = 300
  Heat Transfer Coefficient = 10
  Save Scalars = True
End
```

Finally, do not forget to add the new solvers to the model:

```c
Equation 1
  Name = "Model"
  Active Solvers(5) = 1 2 3 4 5
End
```

## Conduction in 3D

Adapting the case for running with a 3D geometry (provided under directory `3d`) is quite simple now. First, we modify the coordinate system under `Simulation` section to cartesian. This is because now we are solving an actual 3D geometry and enforcing specific coordinate systems is no longer required (or formally compatible).

```c
Coordinate System = Cartesian
```

Also remember to include the extra dimension in data saving:

```c
Polyline Coordinates = Size(2, 3);  0.005 0.025 0  0.100 0.025 0
```

For converting the `gmsh` file you can proceed the same way as in 2D. If is worth opening the generated `.msh` file with `ElmerGUI` to inspect the numbering of boundary conditions (it will be later required to be edited in SIF).  Because the sides (symmetry of cylinder) are not present in 2D (it is the plane itself), you need to add an extra boundary condition as follows:

```c
Boundary Condition 4
  Target Boundaries(1) = 4 
  Name = "Symmetry"
  Heat Flux = 0
End
```

To generate the `ElmerSolver` mesh under `domain/` we run the same command as before. Because transient 3D cases are quite computationally intensive, for any practical purposes the simulation must be run in parallel. Domain decomposition is also performed with `ElmerGrid` as follows:

```shell
ElmerGrid 2 2 domain -partdual -metiskway 16
```

In the above command the number `16` represents the number of cores; you might need to adapt for a lower value if running from most laptops (generally with 4 or 6 cores these days). For running in parallel with 16 cores we need to run the command:

```shell
mpiexec -n 16 ElmerSolver_mpi
```

The command `mpiexec` is how the message passing interface (MPI) runner is called in Windows; for Linux this should be `mpirun` instead.

## Understanding heat flux

Depending on problem dimension it might be tricky to understand what the reported values of heat flux correspond to. That is specially tricky when dealing with axisymmetric cases. 

Let's start by analyzing the 2D case. For exploring the meaning of the quantities evaluated by `FluxSolver` we make use of `SaveLine` to get the value of temperature over the radius of the cylinder. The expected heat flux $q$ over the outer radius is given by:

$$
q = U (T - T_{\infty})
$$

In this case we have set $U=10\:W\;m^{-2}\;K^{-1}$ and $T_{\infty}=300\:K$. The computed outer radius temperature is $T\approx{}931.4\:K$, leading to a computed flux of $q=6313.9\:W\;m^{-2}$, which rounds-off to the same value of flux predicted by `FluxSolver`. As expected, we have a value per unit area, the definition of flux.

To get an integral value we used `SaveScalars`, which is plotted below against time. Since the value of heat flux was integrated over the boundary, it is provided in power units. At the final time we have a value of $Q\approx{}198.4\:W$. The segment of cylinder simulated here has an outer radius of $R=0.10\:m$ and height $h=0.05\:m$. With this values in hand it can be shown that the integral quantity is evaluated for $2\pi\:rad$, *i.e.* $Q=2\pi{}Rhq=Aq$.

## Post-processing

ParaView was employed to generate standard animations of temperature evolution in bodies. Below we have the 2D axisymmetric results:

The same was done for 3D equivalent case as illustrated next:
