# Elmer verification

In this notebook we focus on the analysis of steady heat transfer across a multi-layer body composed of different materials. For evaluating the effect of temperature-dependence of thermal conductivity, each material region may be discretized into several slices. Since the radius of the system (~5m) is large compared to the wall thickness (~0.3m) a planar approximation is adopted here to simplify the base computations.

## Model description

In what follows we describe a procedure to solve the steady-state heat equation $\nabla\cdotp{}q^{\prime}=0$ with $q^{\prime}$ given by Fourier's law $q^{\prime}=-k\nabla{}T$. Its goal is to treat numerically the problem with temperature-dependent coefficients, *i.e.* $k\equiv{}k(T)$.

### General development

For simplicity, let's consider a domain of points equally spaced by a distance $\delta$ in 1-D space $z\in[0;L]$. In the left side of the domain we have a Dirichlet boundary condition given by $T(z=0)=T_1$. In the absence of source terms, the heat flux at the first two internodal interfaces can be writen as 

$$
q^{\prime}=-k_{1,2}\dfrac{T_2-T_1}{\delta}=-k_{2,3}\dfrac{T_3-T_2}{\delta}
$$

where $k_{i,j}$ is defined as the harmonic mean of $k_i$ and $k_j$, a requirement for continuity as demonstrated, *e.g*, in [Patankar (1980)](https://doi.org/10.1201/9781482234213). Introducing the coefficients $\alpha_{i,j}=-k_{i,j}\delta^{-1}$ we rearrange this equality as follows; since $T_1$ is know, it is placed on the right-hand side, closing the first equation of the problem with boundary condition included:

$$
\left(\alpha_{1,2}+\alpha_{2,3}\right)T_2 - \alpha_{2,3}T_3 = \alpha_{1,2}T_1
$$

Applying the same approach to the next set of nodes leads to the next equation which applies generically for any triplet of nodes inside the domain:

$$
-\alpha_{2,3}T_2 +
\left(\alpha_{2,3}+\alpha_{3,4}\right)T_3
-\alpha_{3,4}T_4 = 0
$$

On the right size the system is submitted to a general Robin boundary condition given by the heat flux $q^{\prime}(z=L)$ specified in terms of convection and radiation terms; this includes the convective heat transfer coefficient $h$ and surface emissivity $\varepsilon$ to the model parameters.

*Note:* for simplicity of notation and for writing the whole set of equations below, we assume the system is discretized into 5 nodes.

$$
q^{\prime}=-k_{4,5}\dfrac{T_5-T_4}{\delta}=
h\left(T_5-T_{\infty,c}\right)
+\sigma\varepsilon\left(T_5^4-T_{\infty,r}^4\right)
$$

Because of the term expressed as the fourth power of the temperature in the last node, this equation makes the system nonlinear. Notice that this expression considers different temperatures for convection and radiation, $T_{\infty,c}$ and $T_{\infty,r}$, respectively. Below we include a term depending on $T_{\infty,r}$ to the convective heat flux $q_c^{\prime}$:

$$
q_c^{\prime}=
h\left(T_5-T_{\infty,c}\right)=
h\left(T_5-T_{\infty,r}\right)
+h\left(T_{\infty,r}-T_{\infty,c}\right)
$$

which allows the last equation of the system to be reformulated as

$$
-\alpha_{4,5}T_4+\alpha_{4,5}T_5=
h\left(T_{\infty,r}-T_{\infty,c}\right)+
U\left(T_5-T_{\infty,r}\right)
$$

where the global heat transfer coefficient $U\equiv{}U(T_5)$ is introduced; to deal with the nonlinearity we make use of a relation $\tau_5\mapsto{}T_5$ to evaluate the coefficient accross iterations, where $\tau_5$ is the last known approximation of $T_5$ (starting with an initial guess).

$$
U = h + \sigma\varepsilon
\left(\tau_5+T_{\infty,r}\right)
\left(\tau_5^2+T_{\infty,r}^2\right)
$$

Reorganizing the equation leads to

$$
-\alpha_{4,5}T_4+(\alpha_{4,5}-U)T_5=
(h-U)T_{\infty,r}-hT_{\infty,c}=
f(\tau_5)
$$

### Matrix assembly

Putting it all together leads to the following matrix problem:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  (\alpha_{1,2}+\alpha_{2,3})
& -\alpha_{2,3}
& 0
& 0
\\
%%%%%%%%
  -\alpha_{2,3}
& (\alpha_{2,3}+\alpha_{3,4})
& -\alpha_{3,4}
& 0
\\
%%%%%%%%
  0
& -\alpha_{3,4}
& (\alpha_{3,4}+\alpha_{4,5})
& -\alpha_{4,5}
\\
%%%%%%%%
0
& 0
& -\alpha_{4,5}
& (\alpha_{4,5}-U)
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	T_2  \\
	T_3  \\
	T_4  \\
	T_5
\end{bmatrix}
%
=
%
\begin{bmatrix}
	\alpha_{1,2}T_1 \\
	0               \\
	0               \\
	f(\tau_{5})
\end{bmatrix}
$$

In summary this shows that for $N$ temperatures, there is a $N-1$ problem to be solved (as $T_1$ is known) and also $N-1$ interface coefficients $\alpha_{i,j}$.

### Solution strategy

Since the left-hand side matrix depends on the solution itself, solving the model is an intrinsically iterative task; the following steps are proposed:

1. An initial guess $\tau$ of solution is provided
2. The matrix coefficients and $f(\tau_n)$ are evaluated
3. Problem is solved to update the solution $\tau$
4. If for iterations $k$ and $k-1$ all $\vert\tau^{(k)}-\tau^{(k-1)}\vert<\epsilon$, solution is converged, otherwise repeat from the second step until convergence of maximum iterations is reached
