# MATC

Elmer provides a few extension methods. For complex models you might be prompted to use directly Fortran 90. For simpler things, such as providing temperature dependent thermophysical properties, it has its own parser for use in SIF, the metalanguage MATC. Expressions provided in MATC can be evaluated when file is read or during simulation execution.

Because it is quite concise, I summarized the whole of MATC syntax and functions in this page. For the official documentation please refer to [this document](https://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/physics/elmer/doc/MATCManual.pdf).

## Declaring variables

Variables in MATC can be matrices and strings; nonetheless, both are stored as double precision arrays so creating large arrays of strings can represent a waste of memory. For some weird reason I could not yet figure out, MATC language can be quite counterintuitive.

Let's start by creating a variable, say `x` below; attribution, such a in Python, creates the variable. It was stated that everything is a matrix or string; since `x` is not a string, it is actually a $1\times{}1$ matrix and in this case we can omit the indexing when allocating its memory.

```C
x = 1
```

So far nothing weird; when declaring a string as `k` below we are actually creating a $1\times{}5$ row matrix, what is not unusual in many programming languages (except for being double precision here). Furthermore, we use the typical double-quotes notation for strings.

```C
k = "hello"
```

Matrix indexing is zero-based, as in C or Python. Matrix slicing is done as in many scripting languages, such as Python, Julia, Octave, ..., and we can reverse the order of the first *six* elements of an array `y` as follows: 

```C
y(0, 0:5) = y(0, 5:0)
```

Notice above the fact that matrix slicing is *last-inclusive*, as in Julia, meaning that all elements from index zero to five *inclusive* are included in the slice. Weirdness starts when you do something like

```C
z(0:9) = 142857
```

which according to the documentation will produce an array `1 4 2 8 5 7 1 4 2 8`; I could not verify this behavior yet. Additionally, the following produces another unexpected result:

```C
z(9, 9) = 1
```

If matrix `z` does not exist, this results in a $10\times{}10$ matrix with all zeros except the explicitly declared element. The size of variables are dynamic, so in the above if `z` already existed but wa smaller, it would be padded with zeros instead.

Finally, logical indexing is also allowed:

```C
x(x < 0.05) = 0.05
```

## Control structures

MATC provides conditionals and loops as control structures. Below we have the `if-else` statement, which can be declared inline of using a C-style declaration using braces.

```C
if ( expr ) expr; else expr;

if ( expr )
{
    expr;
    ...
    expr;
} else {
    expr;
    ...
    expr;
}
```

Loops can be declared using both `for` or `while`. There is no mechanism of generating values within a `for` loop and one must provide a vector of indexes for repetition. *In the official documentation there is no reference to a `continue` or `break` statement and I could not verify their existence yet*.

```C
for( i=vector ) expr;

for( i=vector )
{
    expr;
    ...
    expr;
}

while( expr ) expr;

while( expr )
{
    expr;
    ...
    expr;
}
```

## Operators

Assume the following definitions:

- `a`, `b` and `c` ordinary matrices  
- `l`, `t` and `r` logical matrices 
- `s`, `n` and `m` scalars

## Function definitions

The syntax of the function definition is similar to that of Julia and is given below. The function body is enclosed by braces. Instead of using a `return` statement, the resulting value is attributed to a variable named after the function with a leading underscore. Notice the `!` denoting comments in the description of the function.

```Fortran
function name(arg1, arg2, ...)
!
! Optional function description (seen with help("name"))
!
import var1, var2
export var3, var4
{
    expr;
     ...
    expr;

    _name = value
}
```

Functions have their own list of variables. Global variables are not seen in this function unless imported by `import` or given as arguments. Local variables can be made global by the `export` statement. 

Functions, if returning matrices, behave in many ways as variables do. So if you have defined function `mult` as follows 

```Fortran
function mult(a, b)
{
   _mult = a * b;
}
```

You can get element (3,5) of the `a` times `b` matrix with `mult(x,y)[3,5]` or the diagonal values of the same matrix by `diag(mult(x, y))`.

## Built-in functions

### C-style math

The following listing provides a series of mathematical functions which follow a their meaning in C. The only exceptions are `ln` denoting the natural logarithm and `log` used here for base 10 logarithms.

```C
r = sin(x)

r = cos(x)

r = tan(x)

r = asin(x)

r = acos(x)

r = atan(x)

r = sinh(x)

r = cosh(x)

r = tanh(x)

r = exp(x)

r = ln(x)

r = log(x)

r = sqrt(x)

r = ceil(x)

r = floor(x)

r = abs(x)

r = pow(x,y) 
```

## Usage

Although the language is pretty fast for most simple uses, it is much slower than Fortran extensions, so use with case when scalability is needed. Another point is overuse of MATC; do not use it with simple numerical expressions, *e.g.* `OneThird = Real $1.0/3.0` is much faster than its MATC counterpart `OneThird = Real MATC "1.0/3.0"`.

### Direct expression coding

One thing that in my opinion lacks in the documentation are examples of use in conjunction with SIF. For instance, for setting the thermal conductivity of a material as temperature-dependent one could use the following snippet and modify the string to match the desired expression. An example of its usage is provided in [this case](https://github.com/wallytutor/WallyToolbox.jl/blob/main/apps/Elmer/conduction_refractory/transient_parallel/case.sif).

```C
  Heat Conductivity = Variable Temperature
    Real MATC "1.0 - tx * (2.5E-03 - 1.2E-06 * tx)"
```

### Sourcing functions from user modules

Models can become too complex to code in a single line. Hopefully MATC provides functions which can be declared in external modules. I avoid coding MATC directly in SIF because their syntax is different and that can quickly lead to unmaintainable code. An example of such external sourcing is provided in [this case](https://github.com/wallytutor/WallyToolbox.jl/tree/main/apps/Elmer/diffusion_solids/carburizing_slycke). You need to remember to call `source("module")` in `Simulation` section of SIF so that the functions can be used elsewhere.  The call of a function become something as

```C
  Concentration Diffusivity = Variable Concentration
    Real MATC "diffusivity(tx)"
```

if independent variable is concentration or for time

```C
  Mass Transfer Coefficient = Variable Time
    Real MATC "masstransfercoef(tx)"
```

You can even use multiple variables, *e.g.*

```C
  Mass Transfer Coefficient = Variable Time, Temperature
    Real MATC "masstransfercoef(tx(0), tx(1))"
```

 PS: *I managed to use a single `source` in SIF, although the documentation does not state that many sources are forbidden; for some reason multiple sources work when sourcing from a file.*
	
For more complex cases such as [this one](https://github.com/wallytutor/WallyToolbox.jl/tree/main/apps/Elmer/diffusion_solids/carburizing_slycke_gui) it is worth writing actual MATC function modules; since there is no syntax highlighter available for MATC in VS Code, the `.ini` extension seems to provide better readability to the code. The problem was split in two parts: the [models](https://github.com/wallytutor/WallyToolbox.jl/blob/main/apps/Elmer/diffusion_solids/carburizing_slycke_gui/models.ini) which take care of sourcing the [conditions](https://github.com/wallytutor/WallyToolbox.jl/blob/main/apps/Elmer/diffusion_solids/carburizing_slycke_gui/conditions.ini), so that basic users could only edit the latter and run their variant calculations with no coding skills. Notice that the symbols that are used in [SIF](https://github.com/wallytutor/WallyToolbox.jl/blob/main/apps/Elmer/diffusion_solids/carburizing_slycke_gui/case.sif) are exported from [this line](https://github.com/wallytutor/WallyToolbox.jl/blob/main/apps/Elmer/diffusion_solids/carburizing_slycke_gui/models.ini#L72) instead of being set as global variables.
