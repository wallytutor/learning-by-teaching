# Containers

## Podman

In the open source community [podman](https://podman.io/) takes the place of [docker](https://www.docker.com/) for the creation of application containers. It mimics the commercial software to allow developers work with both tools *almost* interchangeably. It is not uncommon to find people creating aliases of `docker` in their sandbox environments to point to their `podman` executable. One must be aware that although the command interfaces are very similar, they are not the *exactly* same and advance usage requires mastering each of them individually.

The following summarizes some daily life commands with `podman`.

- List available images in a local machine:

```bash
podman image
```

- Run image `<img>` interactively using bash:

```bash
podman run -it <img> /bin/bash
```

- Dump image `<img>` to `<img>.tar` for portability:

```bash
podman save -o <img>.tar <img>
```

## Apptainer

Using `podman` locally is great, but packaging redistributable containers for reuse in HPC is much smoother with [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/). The tool started at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) can be [downloaded](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/releases) for several Linux systems and deployed locally. Under Debian (or its variants, as Ubuntu), navigate to the download directory and install with the following, taking care to replace the right version:

```shell
export APPTAINER_VERSION=1.3.6_amd64.deb

sudo dpkg -i apptainer_${APPTAINER_VERSION}
# sudo dpkg -i apptainer-dbgsym_${APPTAINER_VERSION}
# sudo dpkg -i apptainer-suid_${APPTAINER_VERSION}
# sudo dpkg -i apptainer-suid-dbgsym_${APPTAINER_VERSION}
```

- Converting a local `podman` dump into a Singularity image:

```bash
apptainer build "<img>.sif" "docker-archive://<img>.tar"
```

- Running an `apptainer` image as a non-root user is as simple as:

```bash
apptainer run <img>.sif
```

**IMPORTANT:** since `apptainer` makes use of user space, sourcing of applications is not done as root, so one must edit add to their `~/.bashrc`, see an exemple for [OpenFOAM](openfoam/containers/README.md).
