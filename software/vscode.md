# Visual Studio Code

## Basics

If you are reading this, you are probably using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the first time or need a refresher! VS Code is Microsoft's open source text editor that has become the most popular editor in the past decade. It is portable (meaning it works in Windows, Linux, and Mac) and relatively light-weight (it won't use all you RAM as some proprietary tools would do). There are a few shortcuts you might want to keep in mind for using this tool in an efficient manner:

- `Ctrl+J`: show/hide the terminal
- `Ctrl+B`: show/hide the project tree
- `Ctrl+Shift+V`: display this file in rendered mode
- `Ctrl+Shift+P`: access the command pallete
- `Ctrl+K Ctrl+T`: change color theme
- `Alt+Z`: toggle column wrapping
