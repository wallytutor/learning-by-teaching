# FreeCAD notes

- Before starting it is recommended to change navigation mode to *Blender* as that is more natural for CAD systems; if you hover the mouse over the selector it will provide tips on buttons.

- One body means one single solid and sketches must be fully constrained.

- Construction geometry is auxiliary to the sketch process only (no 3D participation); first select the geometry to be used as construction only and then switch mode.

- You can click on a face and select to create a sketch on its plane (do not use options, simply click the sketch button and it will do it automatically).

- Create *external geometry* can be used to link sketches/solids of different stages of the model.

- Prefer STEP or STL format for exporting and use models in other 3D CAD systems.
