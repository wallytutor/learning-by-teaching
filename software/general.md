# General Tips

## Running Jupyterlab from a server

#programming/python/jupyter 

Before running the server it is a good idea to generate the user configuration file:

```bash
jupyter-lab --generate-config
```

By default it will be located at `~/.jupyter/jupyter_lab_config.py`. Now you can add your own access token that will simplify the following steps (and allow for reproducible connections in the future).

```python
c.IdentityProvider.token = '<YOUR_TOKEN>'
```

The idea is illustrated in [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69244218) thread; first on the server side you need to start a headless service as provided below. Once Jupyter starts running, copy the token it will generate if you skipped the user configuration step above.

```bash
jupyter-lab --no-browser --port=8080
```

On the host side (the computer from where you wish to edit the notebooks) establish a ssh tunel exposing and mapping the port chose to serve Jupyter:

```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 <REMOTE_USER>@<REMOTE_HOST>
```

Now you can browse to `http://localhost:8080/` and add the token you copied earlier or your user-token you added to the configuration file.

## Downloading from YouTube

#programming/python/tips 

Retrieving a video or playlist from YouTube can be automated with help of [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

To get the tool working under Ubuntu you can do the following:

```bash
# Install Python venv to create a local virtual environment:
sudo apt install python3-venv

# Create an homonymous environment:
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the local environment:
source venv/bin/activate

# Use pip to install the tool:
pip install -U --pre "yt-dlp[default]"
```

**NOTE:** alternative applications as [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and [pytube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/) are now considered to be legacy as discussed in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/18wzsg8/good_pytube_alternative/).

## Installing Python packages behind proxy

#programming/python/tips 

To install a package behind a proxy requiring SSL one can enforce trusted hosts to avoid certificate hand-shake and allow installation. This is done with the following options:

```bash
pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org <pkg>
```

## Extracting text from PDF

Provides reference text exported from PDF files. 

The engine uses a combination of [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and [PyPDF2](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2) to perform the data extraction. Nonetheless, human curation of extracted texts is still required if readability is a requirement. If quality of automated extractions is often poor for a specific language, you might want to search the web how to *train tesseract*, that topic is not covered here.

Besides Python you will need:

- Tesseract (and a language pack) for extracting text from PDF.
- ImageMagick for image conversion.
- Poppler utils for PDF conversion

Install dependencies on Ubuntu 22.04:

```bash
sudo apt install  \
    tesseract-ocr \
    imagemagick   \
    poppler-utils
```

In case of Rocky Linux 9:

```bash
sudo dnf install           \
    tesseract              \
    tesseract-langpack-eng \
    ImageMagick            \
    poppler-utils
```

For Windows you will need to manually download both `tesseract` and `poppler` and place them somewhere in your computer. The full paths to these libraries and/or programs is provided by the optional arguments `tesseract_cmd` and `poppler_path` of `Convert.pdf2txt`.

Create a local environment, activate it, and install required packages:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate
    
pip install              \
    "pdf2image==1.17.0"  \
    "pillow==11.0.0"     \
    "PyPDF2==3.0.1"      \
    "pytesseract==0.3.13"
```

Now you can use the basic module [`pdf_convert`](https://github.com/wallytutor/WallyToolbox.jl/blob/main/src/py/pdf_convert.py) provided here.
