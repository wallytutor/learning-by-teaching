## Build

This project is built and packaged with FPM; you might need to download binaries, install, or compile the tool from sources prior to buiding it. Intructions are provided [here](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/install/index.html). Once `fpm` is available, building is just a matter of running the intuitive commands `fpm run`, `fpm build`, etc, and more that you can discover with `fpm --help`, but for convenience we have wrapped everything in a `Makefile`:

- `make`: build the project binaries under `build/` managed by FPM.

- `make dist`: package the project for distribution (ongoing development).

- `make docs`: generate the project documentation.

- `make test`: build and run project tests managed by FPM.

- `make clean`: clean generated binaries managed by FPM.

- `make dist-clean`: clean everything generated by the `Makefile`.
