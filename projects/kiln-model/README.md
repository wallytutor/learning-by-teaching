# Rotary kiln model

## Build

This project is built and packaged with FPM; you might need to download binaries, install, or compile the tool from sources prior to buiding it. Intructions are provided [here](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/install/index.html). Once `fpm` is available, building is just a matter of running the intuitive commands `fpm run`, `fpm build`, etc, and more that you can discover with `fpm --help`, but for convenience we have wrapped everything in a `Makefile`:

- `make`: build the project binaries under `build/` managed by FPM.

- `make dist`: package the project for distribution (ongoing development).

- `make docs`: generate the project documentation.

- `make test`: build and run project tests managed by FPM.

- `make clean`: clean generated binaries managed by FPM.

- `make dist-clean`: clean everything generated by the `Makefile`.

## Development

### Code style

- Do not use closing names for functions, types, subroutines or interfaces; the only closing name to be used is for a module declaration, which is expected to be done as:

```fortran
module my_module

    ...

contains

    ...

end module my_module ! Add its name in this closing line.
```

- Module contents before and after `contains` keywords are indended by 4 spaces.

### Thermo

- Properties evaluated by core thermodynamic models are provided only in molar basis; conversion to mass basis is expected to be done when required by solution managers.
