# List of goals

- [ ] Add Graf (2007) as a baseline comparison to paper.

- [ ] Verification of mechanisms with PSR models with Cantera and chemFoam (simulations/chemFoam)

- [ ] Simulation of experimental conditions with a non-isothermal PFR(src/legacy/)

- [ ] Extension to real geometry of reactor with OpenFOAM(simulations/reactingFoam)

- [ ] Validate new release of PFR model with wall temperature / simulate.

- [ ] Migrate FOAM case preparation from Python to Julia (*majordome*).

- [ ] Run FOAM mesh convergence/simulations and extract results.

- [ ] Export mechanism with pyJac and benchmark in FOAM.

- [ ] Finish paper text and publish.
