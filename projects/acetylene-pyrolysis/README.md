# Acetylene pyrolysis


## Environment setup

- Launch `julia`, activate and instantiate the project available in this repository.

- From Julia's REPL run `using IJulia; IJulia.jupyterlab()` to launch Jupyterlab for the first time

- In Jupyterlab, activate the extensions and install Jupytext (required to edit plain-text notebooks).

- You will be prompted to restart Jupyterlab, so back to REPL, kill the server with `Ctrl+C` and run it again.

Everything should be fine by here to manage the project through the notebook.

```julia
using CairoMakie
```

```julia

```
