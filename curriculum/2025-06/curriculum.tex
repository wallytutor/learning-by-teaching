\ecvsection{Profile and Motivation}%

\ecvitem{}{%
Please let me introduce myself. I am Walter Dal'Maz Silva, 34, married, Brazilian living in France for about 10 years now. I accumulate more than a decade of experience in industry, comprising a first experience in Oil\&Gas, a PhD dedicated to aeronautic and automobile applications, then a career in steel production with a high focus in applied Data Science, followed my current position as a simulation engineer in advanced ceramics. That includes a broad variety of fields, from raw materials manufacture to mechanical construction, both in production settings and research, and also intermediate production technical support.

Fluent in Portuguese, French, and English, I am also self-taught on several subjects, always open to more knowledge. Me and my wife are active trekkers and via ferrata climbers. On my side, I also practice rock climbing and mountain biking since an early age. I am an active member of Club Alpin Français, taking part in activities on some of the above and started to get training to become an activity supervisor at the club. I am also interested in learning languages, cosmopolitan environments, physical sciences, programming, numismatics, and philately.

I come to you through this letter to kindly request the study of my job application and reinforce my interest in the applied position. I strongly believe my past experiences and degrees provide an excellent foundation for the job's responsibilities. Please let me know if any supplementary information is required. You will find in the following sections preceding my career timeline, a self-assessment of relative mastery (filled bar size) across different skill groups. I can find flexible time slots for a phone or online discussion -- or why not in person.
