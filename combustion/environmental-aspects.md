## NOx formation

These notes are mostly based on Warnatz [@Warnatz2006], except where mentioned otherwise.

Four different possible routes:

1. Thermal route (Zeldovich mechanism) at high temperatures; assumes steady state concentration of atomic nitrogen to simplify the rate law of NO formation. The required atomic oxygen concentration can be estimated from *partial-equilibrium* evaluated from $H_2$,, $O_2$, and $H_2O$ in the flame front. This is valid only above 1700 K, but this is no problem because the limiting rate constant in Zeldovich mechanism is very low at this level of temperatures.

2. Prompt route (Fenimore mechanism), accounts for the role of $CH$ radicals in downstream side of flame front; it is favored in rich flames which accumulate acetylene due to $CH_3$ recombination, a precursor for $CH$ radicals. Its production can be important at temperatures as low as 1000 K.

3. Nitrous oxide route

4. Conversion of fuel nitrogen
