# Julia 102

Hello again! Hope you have enjoyed [Julia 101](../101/README.md)!

This second course of the series will extend your Julia skills to the next level. In the previous session we have focused on using Julia from the REPL, but that's not how things work in the *real world*. Now we move towards creating reusable code, packaging it, and calling it from elsewhere. This will include the following topics:

- Types and structures
- Functions and multiple dispatch
- Wrapping up code in modules
- Creating a package

## User-defined types

## Writing your own functions

## Creating reusable modules

## Packaging code
