# Learning by Teaching

Study notes transformed into teaching materials along the way.

## About

My name is Walter [(you find my background here)](curriculum/curriculum.pdf) and I like writing about science and engineering topics. I have more than a decade of scientific computing experience and a broad experience with open source software, especially in the fields of fluid dynamics and gas phase kinetics; a little of it being shared here, among other subjects of my personal interest.

During the years I tried to different formats to organize my study materials and working tools. Recently that I tried coupling my knowledge base with the documentation of my personal code without success and started migrating everything to the simples format you find here. Obviously I cannot migrate all the content I have ever produced here at once, so my decision was to restructure everything and have a fresh start, feeding content as required, *i.e.* somebody asked me a hand in a certain subject or I need to refresh certain skill at work. Sometimes I also write on Medium [articles](https://medium.com/@waltermateriais).

## Projects

Currently I maintaint two main projects:

- [AuChimiste.jl](https://wallytutor.github.io/AuChimiste.jl/dev/)
- [WallyToolbox.jl](https://wallytutor.github.io/WallyToolbox.jl/dev/)

They are fundamentally different in the way they are managed. While `AuChimiste` is being worked on to be published as a Julia package, `WallyToolbox` is where I work out my ideas before they reach maturity. So while the first is expected to be stable, the latter is constantly *melting* away.
