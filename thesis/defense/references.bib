  review = {Conclusion Thermo-Calc is today an established tool for calculating
	thermodynamic properties and phase-equilibria in materials. Over
	the last years the software has been made more accessible.
	
	
	The development of a windows version, TCW, enables materials & process
	engineers to perform advanced calculations in an easy and intuitive
	way.
	
	The amount of available high quality thermodynamic data is continuously
	increasing and thermodynamic databases for new applications e.g.
	environmental issues can now be used in Thermo-Calc.
	
	Programming interfaces allows Thermo-Calc to be used as part of another
	software providing thermodynamic and equilibrium data as a subroutine.
	
	All this has made Thenno-Calc into a whole set of tools with multiple
	applicability in science and industry.
	
	DICTRA has proven itself to be capable of simulating the rate of phase
	transformations and diffusion processes in multicomponent alloys.
	The unique feature of DICTRA is the implementation of several phase
	transformation mode models that adds microstructural information
	or constraints and local equilibrium constraints to the diffusional
	flux calculations. The application of DICTRA to many well known processes
	such as sintering, heat treatment or surface treatments has provided
	new insights both from a scentifical and industrial point of view.}

	a novel approach is proposed. The approach combines an exponential
	integrator and Krylov subspace approximations to the exponential
	function of the Jacobian matrix. The components of the approach are
	described in detail and applied to the ignition of stoichiometric
	methane–air and iso-octane–air mixtures, here described by two widely

	robust even at relatively large time steps and the global error displays
	a nominal third-order convergence. The performance of the approach
	is improved by utilising an adaptive algorithm for the selection
	of the Krylov subspace size, which guarantees an approximation to
	the matrix exponential within user-defined error tolerance. The Krylov
	projection of the Jacobian matrix onto a low-dimensional space is
	interpreted as a local model reduction with a well-defined error
	control strategy. Finally, the performance of the approach is discussed

	the austenitic field was examined by in situ high-energy synchrotron
	X-ray diffraction (HEXRD) and transmission electron microscopy. CrN
	nitrides precipitated in austenite during the enrichment in nitrogen
	and were quantified. Enrichment in nitrogen leads to a fine bainitic
	ferrite microstructure, which contains the CrN nitrides as well as
	some AlN, \{VN\} and MnSiN2 precipitates, with much smaller number
	density. The precipitates are frequently gathered into aggregates.
	By using HEXRD, it was possible to monitor ferrite, austenite, cementite
	and CrN mass fraction during the isothermal bainitic transformation,
	whereas \{HEXRD\} experiments in previous studies focused mostly
	on carbide-free bainite. Ferrite formed first, followed by cementite
	precipitation and, in the case of nitrided steels, increase of CrN
	mass fraction. Enrichment in carbon and/or nitrogen tends to slow
	down the bainitic transformation compared to the initial steel, as
	expected from their austenite-stabilizing character. However, comparison
	between enriched steels shows that kinetics is not simply related
	to the total interstitial content when both carbon and nitrogen are
	simultaneously involved. Possible role of CrN precipitated in austenite
	on ferrite formation acceleration is discussed.},

	- 1 9 0 ~ and 450 ~ (also see Table III). 1. Transformation of retained
	austenite into martensite in the temperature range from -160 ~ to
	- 4 0 ~ The process only occurs in alloys containing more than about
	4.6 at. pct N. The transformation causes an increase of specimen
	length. The effect is not de- tected after aging at room temperature.
	2. Redistribution of nitrogen atoms on aging below 100 ~ Two processes
	are distinguished: segrega- tion of nitrogen atoms to dislocations
	and grain boundaries and the ordering of nitrogen atoms in the martensite
	matrix (i.e., precipitation of coherent a"-Fe~6N2). Both processes
	are rate-controlled by the volume diffusion of nitrogen atoms in
	the mar- tensite. The segregation leads to a volume contrac- tion,
	whereas ordering occurs without apparent length change. The ordering
	causes a hardness increase (about 60 HV0.~ for 4.6 at. pct N) and
	a heat production of about 5.4 k J/mole c~"-Fel6N2. 3. Precipitation
	of incoherent transition nitride a" be- tween 100 ~ and 220 ~ This
	process is accom- panied by a hardness reduction (about 100 HV0.~
	for 4.6 at. pct N), a small increase of length, and an appreciable
	heat production of about 26.6 k J/mole cr The value for the activation
	energy (about 115 kJ/mole) suggests rate control by the diffusion
	of iron atoms along dislocations for accommodation of the volume
	misfit between nitride and matrix. 4. Conversion of intermediate
	a" nitride into T' nitride above 220 ~ This process causes a hardness
	reduc- tion (about 150 HV0.~ for 4.6 at. pct N) and a large length
	decrease. The process is endothermal (about 6.8 kJ/mole "y'-Fe4N).
	The value found for the ac- tivation energy (about 196 k J/mole)
	suggests that combined volume and pipe diffusion of iron atoms is
	rate-controlling. 5. Decomposition of retained austenite above 240
	~ This process overlaps with the conversion of the tran- sition nitilde.
	It causes a length increase and a large production o f heat: (8.2
	- 0 . 3 6 . at. pct N) k J / m o l e austenite. The process is rate-controlled

	of pure iron in a mixture of NH 3 and H2, followed by quenching in
	brine and subsequently in liquid nitrogen. The aging process can
	be divided into two stages. First, a redistribution of nitrogen atoms
	in the martensite matrix occurs (aging time < about 40 hours) in
	three ways: segregation of nitrogen to lattice defects (about 0.07N/100Fe),
	transfer of a small amount of nitrogen (about 0.06N/100Fe) from a/b-
	to c-type octahedral interstices, and local enrichment in an ordered

	transfers from a/b-type octahedral interstices to c-type inter- stices,
	as deduced from the decrease of the a lat- tice parameter: not all
	nitrogen atoms are in c-type octahedral interstices in as-prepared
	martensite. The observation of a constant c lattice parameter is
	quantitatively consistent with the combined ef- fects of segregation
	and transfer. The (unit cell) volume change by the transfer process
	is virtually nil. 3. The dominant part of the nitrogen atoms is in-
	volved in the development of local enrichments of nitrogen while
	maintaining the coherency with the solvent (iron) lattice. Such regions
	can be conceived as coherent o~"-Fel6N2 precipitates, al- though
	the present X-ray diffraction experiment is not sensitive enough
	to detect the extremely weak {002}~,,/{200}~,, "superstructure" reflection.
	This redistribution of nitrogen atoms over c-type octahedral interstices
	changes, in particular, the mean square of the static displacements
	of the iron atoms in the direction of the c lattice parameter, leading

  abstract = {Abstract The relative importance index (RII) method for determining
	appropriate target species for dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC) simulations
	using the directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP)
	method is developed. The adequacy and effectiveness of this \{RII\}
	method is validated for two fuels: n-heptane and isopentanol, representatives
	of a ground transportation fuel component and bio-alcohol, respectively.
	The conventional method of \{DRGEP\} target species selection involves
	picking an unchanging (static) set of target species based on the
	combustion processes of interest; however, these static target species
	may not remain important throughout the entire combustion simulation,
	adversely affecting the accuracy of the method. In particular, this
	behavior may significantly reduce the accuracy of the DRGEP-based
	\{DAC\} approach in complex multidimensional simulations where the
	encountered combustion conditions cannot be known a priori with high
	certainty. Moreover, testing multiple sets of static target species
	to ensure the accuracy of the method is generally computationally
	prohibitive. Instead, the \{RII\} method determines appropriate \{DRGEP\}
	target species solely from the local thermo-chemical state of the
	simulation, ensuring that accuracy will be maintained. Further, the
	\{RII\} method reduces the expertise required of users to select
	\{DRGEP\} target species sets appropriate to the combustion phenomena
	under consideration. Constant volume autoignition simulations run
	over a wide range of initial conditions using detailed reaction mechanisms
	for n-heptane and isopentanol show that the \{RII\} method is able
	to maintain accuracy even when traditional static target species
	sets fail, and are even more accurate than expert-selected target
	species sets. Additionally, the accuracy and efficiency of the \{RII\}
	method are compared to those of static target species sets in single-cell
	engine simulations under homogeneous charge compression ignition
	conditions. For simulations using more stringent \{DRGEP\} thresholds,
	the \{RII\} method performs similarly to that of the static target
	species sets. With a larger \{DRGEP\} threshold, the \{RII\} method
	is significantly more accurate than the static target species sets
	without imposing significant computational overhead. Furthermore,
	the applicability of the \{RII\} method to a DRG-based \{DAC\} scheme
	is discussed. },

	environments Fij are detected in the 100 pet austenite obtained after
	quench at room temperature: Fo.o, I'o.,,,, Ft.o, Fl.m, F2.o, where
	i andj indicate the respective numbers of first- and second-nearest
	nitrogen neighbors of an iron atom. No ordering is concluded, contrary
	to the FesC structure in the Fe-C austenite, even though the dis-
	tribution is not random. Conversion electron Mrssbauer spectroscopy
	allows detection of a large concentration of inhomogeneity from the
	surface to the bulk as obtained from the gas-nitriding preparation
	far from equilibrium con- ditions. The distribution of interstitials
	seems random in the as- quenched martensite at 78 K. Iron atoms with
	no nitrogen in the first-nearest neighbor shell give rise to a hyperfine
	field distribution ( A , A2, A j) with values larger than 330 kOe
	due to the large strains. Iron atoms at the vertices of the octahedron
	surrounding an interstitial give two spectral components, B a and
	Be, with fields of about 325 and 300 kOe whether the Fe-N direction
	is perpendicular or parallel to the c-axis. Finally, a component
	C* with a field around 280 kOe corresponds to the possibility of
	having two ni- trogen neighbors probably in the N-Fe-N configuration
	along (110). A long-range ordering of nitrogen interstitials during
	the aging and tempering of martensite is followed by looking at the
	spectral changes. Four major stages are detected. 1. The formation
	of small coherent precipitates of a"- Fet6N2 characterized by a component
	A' with a field of about 360 kOe and an activation energy of 95 kJ/mole.
	2. The thickening of the precipitates along [001]~, leading to semicoherent
	precipitates of ot"-Fel6N2 characterized by a component A" with a
	field of about 400 kOe and an ac- tivation energy of 126 k J/mole.
	3. The disappearance of cd'-Fe~6N2 nitride and the forma- tion of
	TLFe4N with an activation energy of 94 kJ/mole. 4. The decomposition
	of retained austenite into y'-Fe4N and ferrite, which constitutes
	the stage of tempering. The environments A' and A" with fields of
	about 360 and 400 kOe are attributed to iron atoms of the ordered
	phase which have no nitrogen first-nearest neighbor but four sec-
	ond-nearest neighbors. Bo and B,, environments are the same in the
	as-quenched and ordered martensites, and the fields differences (314
	vs 325 and 290 vs 300 kOe) reflect only the difference in the temperatures
	of measurements (ambi- ent vs 78 K). The kinetics of ordering of
	the nitrogen interstitials leading to ol"-Fel6N2 can be compared
	to the clustering- ordering synergy leading to a Fe6C carbide before
	its in situ transformation into e-r/ carbide. [t3,WTl Three steps
	were observed from M6ssbauer spectra, o71 which corre- spond to activation
	energies of 74, 75, and 121.5 kJ/mole, respectively: 1. the clustering
	of carbon atoms which form isolated mul- tiplets; 2. the ordering
	of the multiplets which leads to the small carbide precipitates of
	average formula Fe6C and charac- terized by a tweedlike morphology
	within the martensite matrix; f~5~and 3. the formation of e-~/carbide
	from the transformation of Fe6C. The clustering and ordering steps
	are both controlled by the carbon diffusion in iron.V71 Finally,
	the remarkable magnetic and mechanical prop- erties of ot"-Fe~6Nz,
	which lead to an exceptional localized hyperfine field of 400 kOe
	in a ferrite matrix and corre- spond to an average iron moment at
	0 K within the range 2.3 to 2.6 /xB according to Coey e t a/., [291

  abstract = {A methodology to simulate paraequilibrium (PE) growth in multicomponent
	systems using the DIC- TRA (Diffusion-Controlled Transformation)
	software is presented. For any given multicomponent system containing
	substitutional and interstitial elements, the basic approach is to
	define a hypothetical element Z, whose thermodynamic and mobility
	parameters are expressed in terms of the weighted average (with respect
	to site fraction) of the thermodynamic parameters and mobilities
	of the substitu- tional alloying elements. This procedure facilitates
	the calculation of PE phase diagrams and the PE growth simulations
	directly in the Thermo-Calc and DICTRA software, respectively. The
	results of two distinct case studies in multicomponent alloys are
	presented. In the first example, we simulate the isothermal growth
	of PE cementite in an Fe-C-Co-Cr-Mo-Ni secondary hardening steel
	during tempering. This is of practical importance in modeling the
	carbide precipitation kinetics during secondary hardening. In the
	second example, we have presented the results of PE ferrite growth
	during continuous cooling from an intercritical temperature in an
	Fe-Al-C-Mn-Si low-alloy steel. This is of importance to the design
	of triple-phase steels containing an austenite that has optimum stability,
	to facilitate stress-induced transformation under dynamic loading.
	The results of both simula- tions are in good accord with experimental
	results. The model calculations do not consider any resistive or
	dissipative forces, such as the interfacial energy, strain energy,
	or solute drag, and, as a result, the interface velocities represent
	an upper limit under the available chemical driving force.},

	properties of crystals, mainly metals. The foreign atom is assumed
	to substitute for an atom of the matrix. Interstitial solubility
	is in general limited and a second phase forms easily; the mechanical
	properties of this type of alloys are fully discussed in ch. 25.
	(See, however, also § 2.4.2.) The observations to be described here
	were obtained mainly on single crystals. They are thus best suited
	for interpretation by means of dislocation theory (as presented in
	ch. 20). In the discussion of the mechanical properties of terminal
	solid solutions the reader is assumed to be familiar with the mechanical
	properties of pure metals (chs. 21/22) and with the structure of
	solid solutions (described in ch. 3). Solute atoms in some alloys
	occupy preferentially one sublattice, i.e., there is (short range)
	order. Another kind of non-random distribution of the component atoms
	may lead to the formation of precipitates (ch. 15) which greatly
	harden the alloy. A truly random distribution is certainly rare because
	of differences in atomic size, charge etc., which lead to attractive
	or repulsive interactions between solute atoms, precipitation or
	order. The dislocation is influenced by such inhomogeneities on a
	rather fine scale, determined by its interaction force with a “cluster”
	and the dislocation line tension. It is known that a dislocation
	is bent by a force f on its atomic length b to a minimum radius R
	= μb3/f where μ is the elastic shear modulus. In typical hardened
	alloys R = 100b is reached. },

  review = {VI. SUMMARY The sensitivity of the 57Fe M6ssbauer effect to variations
	in the local environment of the target iron atom has led to its use
	in the investigation of the tempering process in martensitic steels.
	M6ssbauer spectroscopy has provided a powerful means for monitoring
	the onset and kinetics of the structural changes which occur during
	tempering. In addition, it has served as a valuable tool in the determina-
	tion of the iron atom-interstitial atom configurations within these
	structures. M6ssbauer effect studies of virgin Fe-C martensite indi-
	cate that carbon atoms predominantly occupy octahedral interstitial
	sites. At least three nonequivalent iron atom en- vironments have
	been observed. However, a disagreement exists as to the exact definition
	of these environments, the nature of the solid solution of carbon
	in iron, and the distri- bution of carbon atoms between octahedral
	and tetrahedral interstitial sites. Although there is a general consensus
	that carbon atoms agglomerate to regions of high carbon content when
	virgin martensite is aged at room temperature, the structure of these
	regions is also debated. One school of thought has a fraction of
	the carbon atoms jumping from tetrahedral interstices during the
	agglomeration process. Another involves the formation of ordered
	FeaC regions. These disagreements remain unresolved. The M6ssbauer
	spectra of e (or "q), X and 0-carbides were first recorded from synthesized
	samples or samples ex- tracted from tempered steels. These techniques
	permitted independent identification of the carbide structure and
	ac- curate determination of the M6ssbauer hyperfine param- eters.
	The spectra of the iron carbides were also recorded in situ, that
	is, within the martensite matrix from which they were precipitated.
	The temperatures at which each carbide is formed and the hyperfine
	parameters defining its spectrum were found to vary appreciably with
	alloy composition. Although Fe-N martensite has not been as widely
	studied as its Fe-C counterpart, this system appears fairly well
	de- fined. Nitrogen atoms in virgin Fe-N martensite occupy octahedral
	interstitial sites in a random manner. Nonequivalent iron atom environments
	associated with iron atoms which are the first, second, and third
	nearest neighbors of a nitro- gen atom have been identified. At room
	temperature, nitrogen atoms were observed to agglomerate by forming
	regions of ordered FemN2 within the body centered tetrag- onal martensitic
	structure. Further aging at 100 ~ leads to the precipitation of a"-Fel6N2.
	At 160 ~ "y'-Fe4N is ob- served to precipitate.}

	various components of martensitic microstructures in steels and other
	ferrous alloys. The first section examines the experiments and strengthening
	theories associated with Fe–Ni and Fe–Ni–C alloys, in which the martensite,
	because of subzero Ms temperatures, can be evaluated with carbon
	atoms trapped in octahedral interstitial sites. The evaluation of
	strengthening in these alloys has been limited to interpreting yield
	strength of unaged, untempered martensite in terms of interstitial
	solid solution strengthening. The second section reviews strengthening
	of martensitic Fe–C alloys and low-alloy carbon steels with above-room-temperature
	Ms temperatures. In these alloys, it is impossible to prevent C diffusion
	during quenching, and strengthening of martensite becomes dependent
	on static and dynamic strain aging due to carbon atom interaction
	with dislocation substructure. In all alloys the dominant strengthening
	component of martensitic microstructures is the matrix of martensitic
	crystals, either in lath or plate morphology, but secondary effects
	due to other microstructural components such as carbides and retained
	austenite are also discussed. },

  review = {5. Summary The above review shows that many factors influence the
	strength of martensitic microstructures in steels and other ferrous
	alloys. While martensitic microstructures are complex, consisting
	of retained austenite and sev- eral possible levels of carbide distributions,
	in addition to martensite crystals of several morphologies, never-
	theless it is the martensite which dominates perfor- mance. In the
	martensite crystals, the role that carbon atoms plays is varied,
	ranging from interstitial solid solution strengthening to segregation
	to dynamic strain aging, depending on whether or not carbon mobility
	can be suppressed during martensite formation and testing. The very
	high hardness of martensitic mi- crostructures, and very high ultimate
	strengths if brittle fracture can be avoided, are very much a function
	of the dynamic interactions which lead to high rates of strain hardening
	during deformation. The atomic and substructural obstacles to dislocation
	motion in marten- site are not fully characterized and require more
	re- search to provide deeper understanding of martensite deformation,
	mechanical properties, and fracture for future demanding structural
	applications.}

	1. Preprecipitation (a) Iron-carbon Segregation of carbon leads to
	a decrease of specific volume whereas clustering does not. Both processes
	are accompanied by a release of heat. Segregation is completed much
	sooner than clustering. Both pro- cesses are controlled by volume
	diffusion of carbon. (b) Iron-nitrogen Segregation of nitrogen atoms
	occurs with kinetics comparable to those found for iron-carbon. No
	indi- cation of clustering was obtained; as compared to iron-carbon
	a less pronounced heat production oc- curs at higher temperatures.
	This heat production is ascribed to precipitation of coherent c~"

	content ( less than 0. 1\%C) in 4-6\% Mn steels and in 5 and 9\%
	Ni steels. The following main contributions to yield strength have
	been quantitatively distinguished: substitutional element solution
	hardening, packet boundaries (high-angle), lath boundaries (low-angle)
	and dislocations within laths. The contribution from martensite packets
	follows an ordinary Petch-Hall relation. In the Mn steels the Petch-Hall
	coefficient is found to be about the same as in ferritic carbon steels,
	but is strikingly lower in the 5 and 9% Ni steel. A fairly constant
	contribution of about 150 N/mm**2 is established for the martensite
	lath boundaries. The dislocation density within the laths is high
	and is consequently responsible for a significant part of the yield
	strength. The dislocation density is found to increase markedly with
	carbon content, which seems to be the apparent reason for the steep
	increase in yield strength with carbon content. When all these contributions
	are taken into account there remains no part of the yield strength
	which can be associated with any strong solid solution hardening
	from carbon. Thus quenched low-carbon lath martensite might be compared
	to a heavily cold-worked ferrite and an increase in carbon content
	in the martensite then is analogous to an increased degree of deformation.},

	the magnitude of the errors introduced in the target predictions.
	The applied error evaluation is variable-dependent and unambiguous

	increasing errors, and the smallest skeletal mechanism that satisfies
	a user-defined error tolerance over a selected domain of applicability
	is readily obtained. An additional module based on life-time analysis
	identifies a set of species that can be modeled accurately by quasi-steady

	for the calculation of carbon and nitrogen profiles for lowalloyed
	steel after carburizing and carbonitriding. It is very flexible and
	can for instance handle multi-treatments like two-step boost and
	diffusion treatments, decarburization, and denitriding. The agreement
	is excellent in some cases and reasonable in others. As a necessary
	part, simple relations for the interaction between carbon and nitrogen
	in austenite, based on the geometric exclusion model, have been developed.
	Based on this model and a literature study, expressions for the carbon
	and nitro- gen diffusion coefficients, including the dependence on
	the carbon and nitrogen concentration, have been derived. A method
	to treat the interaction between alloying elements and carbon and
	nitrogen in steel has been chosen from the literature.}

	to the effect of lowering the gas exchange rate. The experimental
	results show that the result of the carburizing does not depend very
	much on the gas exchange rate. Both the experimental results and
	the theoretical calculations show that the most important effect
	o f lowering the gas exchange rate is that the atmosphere is displaced
	from equilibrium. This is manifested in a much higher methane content
	than at equilibrium. It is suggested that a high methane content
	may be partly responsible for problems reported in connection with
	nonequilibrium atmospheres such as sooting.}

	Upon prolonged tem- pering at this temperature, where the matrix

	platelets. 3. Aging at 403 K and 463 K leads to precipitation of
	incoherent ~"-FeI6N2 platelets. This is accompanied by a decrease
	in hardness and a release of heat. 4. Only one variant of the {001},,

	to a"-platelets each of which can be partly parallel to a habit plane

	by Al are not suitable for high temperature carburization due to
	abnormal grain coarsening. The gear steel 20CrMnTiNb, which is microalloyed
	with 0. 048% Nb and 0. 038% Ti, has been compared with the gear steel
	20CrMn in terms of microstructure in the case of hardened layer and
	in the core after carburizing at 1000 °C for 4 h and mechanical properties
	after carburizing and pseudo-carburizing. The results indicate that
	the fine austenite grains exist in the carburized case of 20CrMnTiNb
	steel, while there is abnormal coarsening and duplex grain structure
	in the case and core of steel 20CrMn. The average prior austenite
	grain sizes are 19.5 and 34.2 μm for the steels 20CrMnTiNb and 20CrMn,
	respectively. In addition, the mechanical properties of 20CrMnTiNb
	steel are superior to those of 20CrMn steel. In particular, the \{HV\}
	hardness of the former is higher than that of the latter by about
	40–70 in the range of less than 0.7 mm in depth. Therefore, the steel
	20CrMnTiNb is suitable for high temperature carburization.},
